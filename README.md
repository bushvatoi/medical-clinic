Database project

Medical Clinic Database:A health provider company has multiple offices in different states. Many doctors work for the company, and each doctor takes care of multiple patients. 
Some doctors just work in one, and others work in different offices on different days. The database keeps information about each doctor. Each patient can be assigned to one or
more doctors.
Specific patient information is also kept in the database. Customers can schedule and cancel appointments either over the phone or using a web portal. Some restrictions apply -
for example, to see a specialist, the patient needs an approval from his/her primary physician.
